# JPEG XL bash converter for GNU/Linux

A initial prototype for self-learning. The code do what I need, none fancy or with custom options, just run the bash script and nothing more. 

There are plans to make it more customizable; pass arbitrary flags/options, input/output custom folders etc. But at the moment and with the free time I have and knowledge, it's fine. 

Any contribution is welcome.

Tested in version: 0.8.1

Requisites:
